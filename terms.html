For those Users using EscholarFOI outside of the India, the User is responsible for complying with any local laws in User’s jurisdiction that might impact User’s right to use the Services. Use of EscholarFOI in geographic areas in which such use is illegal is prohibited (and we reserve the right to exclude use of the Services from such jurisdictions). In addition, a User may not use the Site if he or she is a resident of a country embargoed by the India, or is a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the Indian government.</p>
                          <p>You must complete a registration form to register for and use the Services. In connection with the registration or creation of a user account and profile as a EscholarFOI user, User must provide certain personal information to EscholarFOI, such as your name and email address. User affirms that the personal information provided about User is correct, accurate, and true as of the time of registration or creation of the user profile. User will update personal information on the EscholarFOI website on a regular basis.</p>
                          <p>You will also need to create a username and password to access your account. We call these your "Account Credentials." User is responsible for keeping the Account Credentials confidential and not sharing them with any other person, except that a parent may share Account Credentials with a child that has created an account through the parent. EscholarFOI will not be held responsible for misuse or unauthorized use of User’s Account Credentials.</p>
                          <p>User may log in to a user account via a third party network, such as a sign-in through your Google account.

This information is used to provide the Services to you and your child. In the case of our Heartbeat tool, we are collecting responses to questions to assess a student’s emotional, academic, and cognitive skills. In some cases, your or your child’s personal information, such as essays, answers to test questions, and responses to Heartbeat questions, might be shared with others, such as teachers, schools, and school districts if you are using the EscholarFOI Services through a School & District Plan (as defined below).</p>
                          <p>Before using EscholarFOI Services, EscholarFOI encourages Users to review the Privacy Policy, which explains EscholarFOI’s collection and use of personal information. By using the Site and Services, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information under the Privacy Policy. Please note that if you are located outside the United States, you agree that your personally identifiable information may be transferred to the United States, which may have less protections or offer less rights than your jurisdiction of residence.</p>
                          <p>We also follow special procedures when collecting information from children. For children in the United States that are under the age of 13, we follow the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). If you are a child under 13, you may not register an account for the Site without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian. Consistent with COPPA, EscholarFOI may ask for a User’s age and if we determine a User is under the age of 13, we will ask for a parent or guardian’s email address in order to obtain parental consent before EscholarFOI collects any personal information from the child.</p>
                          <p>You acknowledge that EscholarFOI may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that EscholarFOI deems necessary to validate your registration information. EscholarFOI reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity. </p>
                          <p>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ESCHOLARFOI CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU AND ESCHOLARFOI IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY YOUR IDENTIFY OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY YOU DURING REGISTRATION IS YOUR ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
