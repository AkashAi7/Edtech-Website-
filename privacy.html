If EscholarFOI learns that personally identifiable information of a child has been collected on the Site without parental consent, then we will take appropriate steps to delete this information.

We may ask the child to provide certain information for notification and security purposes, including the Parent's email address, the child’s first name and gender, the child’s username, and password. We may also ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages. Please note that children can choose whether to share their information with us, but certain features cannot function without it. As a result, children may not be able to access certain features if required information has not been provided. We will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.

                                <li>Parents can contact us to request access to, change, or delete their child’s personally identifiable information at <a href="mailto:support@escholarfoi.com" class="text-orange font-100"> support@escholarfoi.com</a>.</li>

To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify a Parent’s identity before granting access to any personally identifiable information.</p>
                            <p>We will retain your child’s information for as long as their account is active or as needed to provide them services. If you wish to cancel your child’s account or request that we no longer use that information to provide them Services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@escholarfoi.com" class="text-orange font-100"> support@escholarfoi.com</a>. We will retain and use their information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
                            <p>If we make material changes to how we use personally identifiable information collected from children, we will notify parents by email in order to obtain parental consent for the new uses of the child’s personally identifiable information.</p>

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use both "persistent cookies," which remain on your computer after you have closed your browser as well as "session cookies," which exist only during a visitor’s online session and disappear from your computer when you close your browser. Locally stored objects or "flash cookies" are data files that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit and are a way for websites to store information for later use. Locally stored objects are different than cookies because they are stored in different parts of your computer than cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. We use cookies, locally stored objects, and web beacons to make your experience with our Site more efficient and customized. Our cookies do not include any sensitive information, but they do help us learn which of our Site pages are visited and what tools and Services are most often used. Please note that in order to use EscholarFOI, your web browser must be configured to accept cookies.</p>

                        <p>In addition, you may be able to adjust your browser settings or other settings so that "do not track" requests are sent to the websites and mobile applications that you use.
