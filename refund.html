                            <p>Users may subscribe to access any of the Services offered through the Site. EscholarFOI offers subscriptions for the Services on a paying basis ("Paid Subscription"):</p>
                            <ul class="request">
                                <li>Paid Subscriptions: We charge a subscription fee for many of the Services on the Site. You can pay for these Subscriptions on a monthly or annual basis ("Subscription Term"). The Subscription Term starts on the date you register for the Service and for monthly subscriptions, ends at the end of each month or for annual subscriptions, ends at the end of the month one year after the initial registration; we do not pro-rate for partial monthly or annual periods. For example, if you started a monthly plan on September 15, 2020, the initial Subscription Term would end September 30, 2020; if you started an annual plan on September 15, 2020, the initial Subscription Term would end on September 30, 2021. If you register for a Paid Subscription, we will ask you to provide a valid credit card for payment of the subscription fees. By providing your credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card the subscription fees on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the plan you selected.</li>
                                <li>School &amp; District Plans: Schools and school districts can contact EscholarFOI to arrange for a plan to be provided to students and teachers of that school or school district ("School &amp; District Plans"). Such plans are negotiated on an individual basis and subject to separate agreements, except that any authorized user under a School &amp; District Plan must agree to this Agreement in using the Site and Services provided under that plan.</li>
                                <li>Authorized Users: Any Paid Subscription may only be accessed by the User who has registered for that subscription and may not be transferred to any other person or User without the written permission of EscholarFOI, except a parent or legal guardian may allow the child that they have registered to access and use their EscholarFOI Account and Account Credentials to access the Services. In the case of School &amp; District Plans, the school or school district is responsible for designating the authorized Users; no person may use the Services under a School &amp; District Plan without first being designated by the school or school district. The number of authorized Users under any single Subscription may not exceed the number of permitted seats paid under that Subscription ("Maximum Seats"). If an authorized User breaches this Agreement, EscholarFOI may terminate that authorized User’s access to the Services. Any use of the Services by a User not authorized under this Agreement or in excess of Maximum Seats shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, entitling EscholarFOI to terminate access by that User.</li>

                            <p>Except in the case of School &amp; District Plans, the fees ("Subscription Fee") for Paid Subscriptions will be set forth on the page where you register for the Paid Subscription. EscholarFOI may change the Subscriptions Fee for Paid Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any such price changes to User. Subscription Fee changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next Subscription Term following the date of the price change. By continuing to use the EscholarFOI Service after the Subscription Fee change takes effect, User accepts the new Subscription Fee (e.g., in the case of a monthly plan, the increase will take effect the following month; in the case of an annual plan, the increase will take effect on the next annual period). If a User does not agree to the Subscription Fee change, it should cancel the subscriptions on the User’s account before the end of the current Subscription Term.</p>
                            <p>Our Paid Subscriptions renew automatically and so a User's payment to EscholarFOI for Subscription Fees will automatically renew at the end of each applicable Subscription Term, unless the Paid Subscription is cancelled by User through User's subscription page before the end of the current Subscription Term. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current Subscription Term However, if User cancels User's payment and/or terminates before the end of the Subscription Term, EscholarFOI will not refund any Subscription Fees already paid to EscholarFOI. Subscription Fees are non-refundable.</p>
                            <p>User agrees to provide EscholarFOI with valid, up-to-date, and complete debit/credit card, contact, and billing details to make any payments for Paid Subscriptions. User further authorizes EscholarFOI to bill such debit/credit card on activation of the Paid Subscription and on the renewal of each Subscription Term. If, for any reason, User’s credit/debit card company refuses to pay the amount billed for the Services, User agrees that EscholarFOI may, at its option, suspend or terminate User’s subscription to the Services and require User to pay the overdue amount by other means acceptable to EscholarFOI. EscholarFOI may charge a fee for reinstatement of suspended or terminated accounts. User agrees that until its subscription to the Services is properly terminated, it will continue to accrue charges for which it remains responsible, even if it does not use the Services. In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, User agrees to reimburse EscholarFOI for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorney fees and other legal expenses. Unless otherwise expressly stated, all fees are stated in Indian rupees.</p>
